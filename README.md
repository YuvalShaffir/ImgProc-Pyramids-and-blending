# ImgProc-Pyramids-and-blending

3rd excercise of the Image Proccessing course, we learned about Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids and how to blend images using them.
I won first place in the blending competition of the course and got bonus points. 

Functionalities:
- Reduce and expand image
- Blur filter generation
- Gaussian pyramid
- Laplacian pyramid
- Using Laplacian pyramid to reconstruct an image
- Pyramid blending
